Ordinalysis is a standalone application dedicated to visualize ordinal data in the feature space. 
The objective is to select the best machine learning strategy based on ordinality's state (quality) in the latent space.
A quantification metrics are also available for the sake of comparison between dimension reduction techniques. 
More details about the quantification metrics can be found in [1] and [2]
